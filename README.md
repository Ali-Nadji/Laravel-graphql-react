**Laravel 5.7:**

This project is a sample and only contents that showcase the graphql Api and the reactJs
views have been kept.

**This project has 2 parts:**

``` markdown
**GraphQL Api**

The package https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel has been used to implemante
the graphQl Api.
You will find the main graphql src files in app/GraphQl directory.

The conf file has been generated in config/graphql.php.
```

``` markdown
**Front End ReactJs**
The project where this API has been implemented was meant to disapear to a nodeJs backend.
That is why I choosed to use the Laravel Preset react command to generate a react empty 
project into my laravel project.
In this why all the new react components written would be easily reused on the future backend.

The src files for the frontend are in ressources/js
```
